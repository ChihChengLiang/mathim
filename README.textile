h2. Building

Build with sbt 0.7.7 here:
http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/

Note that this is the deprecated sbt rather than the new xsbt 0.10 series.

h2. LaTeX rendering

LaTeX rendering depends on the mimeTeX project, an installation of which you will need to run separately.

http://ctan.mackichan.com/support/mimetex/mimetex.html

In theory any CGI-based LaTeX renderer would work.
